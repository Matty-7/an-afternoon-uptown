    summary: 'Credit spread describes the additional yield or valuation spread on a credit-risky claim relative to a stated benchmark. It is an umbrella description: G-spread, Z-spread and OAS specify different calculations. A wider spread can reflect expected losses, risk compensation, liquidity and other market effects.',

    question: 'Does a 200 bp credit spread mean a 2% probability of default?',
    answer: 'No. The quote also depends on recovery, timing, risk compensation, liquidity and the chosen benchmark. Converting it into a probability requires additional assumptions.',

    aliases: ['credit default swap', 'CDS premium', 'par CDS spread'],
    summary: 'A credit default swap transfers specified credit-event risk. The protection buyer pays a premium; the seller owes the contractually defined payment if a covered event occurs. A par CDS spread expresses the premium rate that balances those legs at inception, subject to the contract and valuation assumptions.',

    summary: 'Under the convention here, the basis is the CDS spread minus a comparable cash-bond spread. A negative value means the bond spread is wider. Funding costs, liquidity, balance-sheet constraints and contract differences can keep the gap from closing.',

    summary: 'In securitization, excess spread is income left after the deal’s specified interest costs, servicing and other senior expenses, and charge-offs. Available income can provide credit support under the waterfall. Its definition, permitted use and any trapping triggers depend on the transaction.',
